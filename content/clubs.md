### Linux Users Group of Notre Dame
At NDLUG's weekly meetings, different members of the club give 
talks a great variety of topics from syntax highlighting to 
front-end web development to the wonders of Elm. Most, if not 
all, of us run some linux distribution for our daily use (currently 
I am running Arch Linux). Being a member of LUG, I have been 
exposed to areas of computer science that I hadn't even known 
existed. I love learning about all the projects that my fellow 
computer science majors are working on.

### Latino Honor Society

The Latino Honor Society is a group of motivated, intelligent, 
and perserverant hispanics who strive for academic excellence. 
As minority students, we support and encourage each other to 
maintain a high level of academic performance. LHS is made up 
of individuals from all majors and all walks of life with the 
same goal: to succeed at Notre Dame and beyond. Our love of 
learning keeps us on the path to excellence and is what motivates 
us every day. 

### Society of Women Engineers

As a member of the Society of Women Engineers, I have gotten to 
learn more about being a woman in the field of engineering, and 
especially within computer science. I have become a part of a 
network of strong, intelligent women who strive to break through 
the glass ceiling.
