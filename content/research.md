##### Summer 2018 - Dr. Walter J Scheirer

During the 11 weeks of my REU I worked on two projects: 
Scalable Hardware Aware Distributed Hyperparameter 
Optimization (SHADHO) and Flexible Learning-Free 
Reconstruction of Imaged Neural Volumes (FLoRIN).

During the first few weeks, I debugged and wrote tests for 
both projects to ensure accurate and precise functionality. 
For the remainder of the Summer, I worked on implementing 
and using FLoRIN for biometric applications.
