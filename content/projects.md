### Jukestapose

A few of my friends and I had always been discussing the idea of 
a collaborative song queue application in which any one of us could 
add songs to the queue and the central application would play the 
songs from that queue. The idea behind Jukestapose is to replace the 
one friend who has youtube or spotify open on their computer and is 
constantly taking song requests to add to the queue which we all enjoy 
together. 

Jukestapose would be run by a central "server" (raspberry pi) 
which is connected via bluetooth to a set of speakers. Users can access 
a webpage run on the server and add songs to the play queue. The server 
then creates the play queue by choosing user-specified songs in a round 
robin fashion to give everyone a chance to listen to their songs. A 
partially working prototype was demoed at ScarletHacks 2017. 

This project is still under construction.

### Chkr.io

Chkr.io is a hackathon project dreamed up by a few friends and me. 
The idea behind the application is to check news articles and reddit 
comments for factual accuracy and information consensus. 

The app takes in an article or reddit post and compares the "facts" 
stated within to a database of "facts" gathered from reputable news 
sources such as the New York Times and BBC. A working prototype was 
demoed at TigerHacks 2017.

### Checkers

For my Data Structures class, I used Python and PyGame to implement 
a game of checkers. The game allows you to choose either two player 
or one player, in which you can play against an AI I created. In the 
creation of this project I learned a lot about edge case testing, 
especially in making sure that the AI only made valid moves. I hoped 
to continue working on this project by increasing the complexity of 
the AI by incorporating the minimax algorithm for move decision.
