### Bio

My name is Cami Carballo and I am a Senior studying Computer Science at 
the University of Notre Dame. I am from Miami, FL, where I have lived 
my whole life with my big, loud family. My dad and his family are 
originally from Puerto Rico, while my mom and her family are from Cuba. 

I came in to Notre Dame thinking I would major in English, but decided 
to give the College of Engineering a try. After my second semester, I 
knew Computer Science was the major for me and promptly ditched the 
English major. In my undergraduate years here, I have found a few 
particular interests within the field of Computer Science, namely 
operating systems and computer architecture.

### Hobbies

I have spent many hours installing and messing around with various Linux 
distributions, including Ubuntu, Antergos and Solus, currently settling 
on Arch Linux. I was originally introduced to Linux by the Linux Users 
Group on campus, where I quickly became involved as an officer (Treasurer 
2017-2018). 

Even though I spend almost all of my time on my computer working on some 
project or other, I do have other hobbies. I love to read, particularly 
fiction novels, listen to music, and spend time with my family and friends.
